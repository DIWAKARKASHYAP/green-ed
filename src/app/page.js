// ## Inspiration
// There are very few websites discussing climate change, and an alarmingly small number of people are aware of its effects

// ## What it does
// Our website is dedicated to helping individuals comprehend the complex issue of climate change, its far-reaching impacts, and its potential solutions. We strive not just to raise awareness, but also to provide actionable strategies to combat these environmental challenges. Additionally, we keep our community updated with live news related to climate change, ensuring our users are always informed and engaged
// , user can also use discord for question . link in footer of website
// ## How we built it
// I developed this website as an effective tool for raising awareness about climate change, using cutting-edge technologies. The tools employed include Next.js 13 for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and newsapi for real-time news updates. Visual Studio Code was my choice of IDE, 

// ## Challenges we ran into
// As a React developer, I've previously only used Next.js 12. However, for this project, I decided to venture into using Next.js 13 for the first time. This proved to be a significant challenge due to the major changes in this version, including server-side rendering, altered folder structure, and more. Nevertheless, I successfully adapted to these changes. Regarding the selection of an API for the project, I initially tried three different ones from RapidAPI. I found that many were either not updated or dysfunctional. Consequently, I switched to using the newsapi.org API, which has proven to work effectively.

// ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
// i successfully created a web app which provide information about climate change , news , solution 

// ## What we learned
// in tech , i learned Next 13 and while building i learn about various effect and impact of climate change like Ocean Acidification,  Economic Impact of climate change , Biodiversity loss by climate change , Impact of Climate Change on Human Health and Marine Life

// ## What's next for green Ed
// My goal is to expand this website's reach and cultivate a larger community for the greater good. By fostering an informed society, we can facilitate proactive measures to save lives and our precious Earth. After all, the more people are aware of the issue, the more substantial and effective actions can be taken against climate change
